title: Top 3 Uncomfortable Things I’ve Done in a Software Developer Interview
---
## Asked for a moment to take a breath and regroup

Hard to admit but yes, for the interview for my current role, I asked for a moment to take a breath. I felt like I was jumping at answering every single question quickly the moment the question ended by the interviewers. I didn’t feel like myself, I felt like a robot. Most importantly, my mind was racing so fast, I wasn’t truly taking a moment to take in the question and think about a true, reflective answer that properly represented my experience. I try to be honest in interview because I like to make sure that the company and role is a good fit for myself, my lifestyle, and my growth as a professional. So yes, totally take a moment to have a breath and regroup to get a clear mind and truly feel like myself when answering the questions.

## Asked to Google something

During my interview at Rackspace, I asked my interviewers (of course 5 developers/all men) to “Google” something. It was my first time working with Angular, they asked a question that I had no clue about so I asked if I could google the Angular docs. After reading the docs, I was able to answer the question sufficiently. Trying to interview for a position using a new technology (for me it was AngularJS), you’re not going to know all the answers and that’s okay. By doing this, I also feel that I represented what type of developer that I am. I don’t memorize all the documentation, but I know where to find answers.

## Requested an interview redo after bombing

Get ready, because this is my embarrassing story. GOOD LESSON TOO SO LISTEN UP. This was early in my career and I did not know that job interviewers (remote) could ask you to share your screen and start coding on the spot. PS ABSOLUTELY NO HEADS UP. First off, was really thrown off the spot that an interviewer could even ask to do that with no heads up.

Embarrassing story part (finally). As I was coding a table (yuck) on the spot, I received a text message from my good friend, “Megan Butt Floss. ”Another story for another day. Every person on the call went silent, saw the text message (and obviously the name) and you could just feel the awkwardness. I was really thrown off after that, did not perform my best and bombed the interview.

Lesson learned, ask HR/interviewer/the appropriate party before the interview if you are going to be expected to live code/share your screen/code on the spot. I will literally decline if asked during an interview if the information was not communicated. It’s courteous to let someone know so that they can prepare their computer properly (and not receive text messages from their friends with the name “Butt” in them). But also, do your due diligence so that you can be prepared for all scenarios.

Back to the point of the story though, I did ask for an interview redo where my computer was prepared ahead of time not to receive notifications, had the proper tools available, and was overall prepared to live code with no distractions. Ultimately, the interview went well but at the end of the day the huge lesson I learned was not “be prepared for anything” it was to do your due diligence and ask what is going to be expected from you. You will be prepared, undistracted, and ready to give your best knowing what is expected for you to represent yourself accurately.

Hope these interview tips helped. At the end of the day, I am who I am, and I like working for companies who support my values. I try to represent that as best as I can in interviews and you should too.

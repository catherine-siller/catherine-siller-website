title: Work From Home Space - Cute and Intentional
---
Many of us have migrated from the offices to our homes amidst the covid pandemic, making our homes not the place to get away from work but the place to do all the things from.

I’m a weirdo — I can literally work from anywhere in the world with just my laptop. I’ve worked from car many times in my career as a software developer. Wherever, whenever, just give me a laptop and a hotspot and we’re good to go.



Even though my work space is not big or typical for a software developer, I’ve made it intentional. It is functional, minimal, and every piece of it has intention to make me successful, both professionally and personal.

1. The chair is uncomfortable af (BUT SO DANG CUTE AND PINK! LOOK AT IT!)

   If you’re like me and gained the covid19 (pounds, lbs, weight, etc), you seek activity where you can get it. I’ve been more conscious about not sitting at my desk too long and being active more intentionally through out the day. The chair isn’t the most uncomfortable either, but it’s intention so I will go on walks more, stand at my kitchen bar, and take breaks more often.

2. I’m intentional about having fidgets around such as crystals when I need to refocus.

   I context switch A TON at work. If you’re someone who is constantly getting Slacks and bouncing from subject to subject, it can be challenging to refocus so that you can actually get shit done and code. When I need to recenter, I’ll grab a crystal and breathe for a few minutes to recenter my energy and focus on task at hand.
3. Inspirational notes bring positivity to the day.

   I think any positive reminders we can have throughout the day help. My boss suggested that instead of saying “I have to” say “I get to” so I wrote it down on a post it note and put in on my monitor. Throughout the day I remind myself of that saying so I get into the habit of saying “I get to”. This year has been a lot of “I have to-s” and not very fun ones — so this has helped even with my personal life. I GET TO spend all my time with my cat :)



When I think of a work space, hardware is important but I also think the energy of your space with intentions are just as important. Set reminders and things in your space that keep you healthy in mind, body, and spirit while giving you the things you need to be successful at your job. I try to have fun. positivity, and happiness where I can nowadays.
